2.How to run my program:</br>

(2)Run "npm install";</br>
(3)Run "npm test";</br>
you can also judge it by looking my main.js and my main-spec.js;</br>

3.About my function:</br>
(1)Judge the id,if id > length of lines,return Cannot find id;</br>
(2)Judge the format of the words in every line,if it is not it should be, return Error: id;</br>
(3)Judge whether the state's coordinate equals the pre state plus its displacements,if not,</br>
  return Error: id;</br>
(4)Now,the UAV must be in normal situation,return id and it's coordinate and plane number;</br>
(5)End!!!!</br>
