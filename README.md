(1)I use JavaScript to finish my homework,and I use TDD to test my program;

(2)How to run my program:
1.Open terminal;
2.Run "npm install";
3.Run "npm test";
you can also judge it by looking my main.js and my main-spec.js;

(3)About my function:
1.Judge the id,if id > length of lines,return Cannot find id;

2.Judge the number of the words in every line,if number < it should be, return Error: id;

3.Judge whether the state's coordinate equals the pre state plus its displacements,if not,
  return Error: id;

4.Now,the UAV must be in normal situation,return id and it's coordinate and plane number;

5.End!!!!

(4)I have draw a tasking picture in my folder,it can help you to understand my program easier;

(5)I also put it in my github,my address is https://github.com/kelly233;
